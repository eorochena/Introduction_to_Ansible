# Introduction to Ansible

Among the several configuration management tools available,  Ansible is probably the easiest to use due to the simplicity 
and its massive amount of modules, this contributes to its growing popularity. In this course we will learn the basics of
this tool by covering the following objectives: 

- Ansible Core Concepts.
- Run Ansible Playbooks.
- Configure Applications

## Ansible Core Concepts

### Modules

Ansible Modules are scripts that come with the ansible package and are used to accomplish several tasks.

### Tasks

Tasks are actions in ansible. You can also execute tasks with ad-hoc commands.

### Roles 

Ansible Roles are ways of automatically load certain vars_files, tasks and handlers based on a known file 
structure. Grouping content by roles also allows easy sharing of roles with other users.

### Playbooks

Playbooks are Ansible's configuration, deployment and orchestration language. Playbooks can describe a policy or a process
you want to deploy on a remote system.
